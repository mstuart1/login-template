This template is for non-nextJS react apps to provide secure authentication and authorization with protected routes, httponly jwt cookies, node express backend endpoints and session management.

This template is set up with a Prisma ORM on the Express backend.

This template uses tailwindcss.

It is intended for grab and go functionality to add to any React app that is not NextJS. NextJS has NextAuth that you can use instead of creating your own session management.
